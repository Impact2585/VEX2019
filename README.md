# VEX 2019
Team 2585 VEX control software for 2018-19

## Info
This project uses Vex Coding Studio (VCS) for the development environment and for uploading code to the VEX v5 brain.
The only required file to edit and run the code is the VEX2019.vex file.
The src folder is included in this project only for convenience, in order to have a text copy of the code contained in the .vex file.

## Contributing
To contribute to this project, make your changes with VCS and save those changes in the VEX2019.vex file. Then update main.cpp and robot-config.h in src/ to reflect those changes.
